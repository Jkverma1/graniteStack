        Unless specified otherwise in the Plan Terms, such Fees are payable in

        (b) you wish to change your direct debit account or personal details.
        For any changes to take effect for your next direct debit payment, we
        must receive your request at least 10 Business Days before that direct
        debit due date. Changes made to your billing account will not affect
        charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act
        on your changes to your billing account. <br />
        8.8 If a direct debit is scheduled to be made on a day other than a
        Business Day, that direct debit will be made on the next Business Day.

        first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the
        charge. If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all
        liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be
        required to correct the error or provide a refund, unless otherwise
        required by law. If we have identified a billing error, we will correct

        a third party after that time, <br />
        unless it became so generally available, known or received (as
        applicable) as a direct or indirect result of an unlawful act or breach
        of confidentiality about which the Recipient knew or ought reasonably
        (after due enquiry) to have known; <br />

        Confidential Information merely because it is included in more generally
        non-confidential information, nor to any specific combination of

        amounts owed under this agreement. If you have obtained an exemption
        from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are
        levied or assessed, you may provide to us any such exemption information
        and we will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents
        as may enable you to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid
        from any relevant revenue authority if such a refund or credit is
        available. <br />
        19.8 You will pay all Fees net of any applicable withholding taxes. We
        will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a

        exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you
        with reasonable documentary proof. You will provide us with reasonable
        evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld
        or deducted.
