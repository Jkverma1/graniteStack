        We may also refuse access where the personal information relates to
        existing or anticipated legal proceedings, and the information would not
        be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings. If we
        refuse to give you access, we will provide you with reasons for our
        refusal.

      <h3 class="pt-4">Correcting your personal information</h3>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        We will amend any personal information about you that is held by us and
        that is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date if you request us to do
        so. If we disagree with your view about the accuracy, completeness or
        currency of a record of your personal information that is held by us,
        and you ask us to associate with that record a statement that you have a
        contrary view, we will take reasonable steps to do so.
      </p>
      <h2 class="pt-4">Storage and security of your personal information</h2>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the information
        that you provide us and we will take all reasonable precautions to
        protect your personal information from unauthorised use or alteration.
        In our business, personal information may be stored both electronically
        (on our computer systems and with our website hosting provider) and in
        hard-copy form. Firewalls, anti-virus software and email filters, as
        well as passwords, protect all of our electronic information. Likewise,
        we take all reasonable measures to ensure the security of hard-copy
        information.

      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        You may click-through to third party websites from this site, in which
        case we recommend that you refer to the privacy statement of the

      <h2 class="pt-4">Re-marketing</h2>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        We may use the Google AdWords and/or Facebook re-marketing services to
        advertise on third party websites to previous visitors to this site
        based upon their activity on this site. This allows us to tailor our
        marketing to better suit your needs and to only display advertisements
        that are relevant to you. Such advertising may be displayed on a Google
        search results page or a website in the Google Display Network or inside
        Facebook. Google and Facebook may use cookies and/or pixel tags to
        achieve this. Any data so collected by Google and/or Facebook will be
        used in accordance with their own respective privacy policies. None of
        your personal Google and/or Facebook information is reported to us.
        <br />
        You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the
        Google Ads Settings page (https://www.google.com/settings/ads). Facebook
        has enabled an AdChoices link that enables you to opt out of targeted
        advertising.

      <h2 class="pt-4">GDPR</h2>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        The Company welcomes the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of
        the European Union (“EU”) as an important step forward in streamlining
        data protection globally. We intend to comply with the data handling
        regime laid out in the GDPR in respect of any personal information of
        data subjects in the EU that we may obtain.
      </p>
      <h3 class="pt-4">GDPR rights</h3>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        The requirements of the GDPR are broadly similar to those set out in the
        Privacy Act and include the following rights:
        <br />
        ● you are entitled to request details of the information that we hold
        about you and how we process it. For EU residents, we will provide this
        information for no fee;
        <br />
        ● you may also have a right to:
        <br />
        − have that information rectified or deleted;
        <br />
        − restrict our processing of that information;
        <br />
        − stop unauthorised transfers of your personal information to a third
        party;
        <br />
        − in some circumstances, have that information transferred to another
        organisation; and
        <br />
        − lodge a complaint in relation to our processing of your personal
        information with a local supervisory authority; and
        <br />
        ● where we rely upon your consent as our legal basis for collecting and
        processing your data, you may withdraw that consent at any time.
        <br />
        If you object to the processing of your personal information, or if you
        have provided your consent to processing and you later choose to
        withdraw it, we will respect that choice in accordance with our legal
        obligations. However, please be aware that:
        <br />
        ● such objection or withdrawal of consent could mean that we are unable
        to provide our services to you, and could unduly prevent us from
        legitimately providing our services to other customers subject to
        appropriate confidentiality protections; and
        <br />
        ● even after you have chosen to withdraw your consent, we may be able to
        continue to keep and process your personal information to the extent
        required or otherwise permitted by law, in particular:
        <br />
        − to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be
        expected as part of running our business and which does not materially
        impact on your rights, freedoms or interests; and
        <br />
        − in exercising and defending our legal rights and meeting our legal and
        regulatory obligations.

        Storage and processing by third parties
        <span class="blue-text">third parties</span>
      </h2>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        Data that we collect about you may be stored or otherwise processed by
        third party services with data centres based outside the EU, such as
        Google Analytics, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Apple, etc and
        online relationship management tools. We consider that the collection
        and such processing of this information is necessary to pursue our
        legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected (eg, to
        analyse how our customers use our services, develop our services and
        grow our business) and which does not materially impact your rights,
        freedom or interests. The Company requires that all third parties that
        act as “data processors” for us provide sufficient guarantees and
        implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure
        your data, only process personal data for specified purposes and have
        committed themselves to confidentiality.
      </p>
      <h2 class="pt-4">Duration of retention of your data</h2>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        We will only keep your data for as long as is necessary for the purpose
        for which it was collected, subject to satisfying any legal, accounting
        or reporting requirements. At the end of any retention period, your data
        will either be deleted completely or anonymised (for example, by
        aggregation with other data so that it can be used in a non-identifiable
        way for statistical analysis and business planning). In some
        circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data.
      </p>
      <h2 class="pt-4">Keeping your information up-to-date</h2>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        To ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date,
        please promptly advise us of any changes to your information by
        contacting our data protection officer by email at
        support@granitestack.com or by post.
      </p>
      <h2 class="pt-4">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p class="default-p pt-4">
        From time to time, it may be necessary for us to revise this Privacy
        Policy. Any changes will be in accordance with any applicable
        requirements under the Privacy Act and the Australian Privacy
        Principles. We may notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy by
